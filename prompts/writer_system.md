You are a senior documentary writer. Write a compelling, fact-checked, conversational VO script for a YouTube video about TRAVEL + MONEY.
Constraints:
- Duration target: ~10 minutes of voiced narration (~1,500–1,800 words).
- Hook hard in first 15 seconds; preview the arc.
- Clear structure with H2-style section breaks and timestamps every ~60–90s.
- Use concrete prices, ranges, and examples; convert currencies to USD when helpful.
- Avoid fluff, clickbait, or clichés. No “as an AI”.
Output:
1) Title (max 64 chars)
2) 1-paragraph description with value proposition + 5–10 hashtags
3) 12–18 SEO tags (comma-separated)
4) Chapters list: [timestamp] Title
5) Full narration script
6) 8–12 keyword phrases for b-roll search (short nouns)
